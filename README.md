# Camper Rental Application

This application is designed for a company offering camper rental services in Ukraine. It consists of three main pages:

1. **Home Page:** Provides a general overview of the services offered by the company. Styling and layout are at your discretion.
2. **Catalog Page:** Displays a catalog of campers with different configurations that users can filter by location, equipment, and type.
3. **Favorites Page:** Shows advertisements added by the user to their favorites.
4. **Advert details:** Modal that shows advertisements details be ID

## Technical Specifications

Based on the provided layout, implement the following features:

- **Advertisement Card:** Implement a card layout for displaying camper rental advertisements.
- **Pagination:** Display 4 advertisements on the first page of the catalog, and load more on click of the "Load more" button.
- **Favorites:** Allow users to add advertisements to their favorites list by clicking on a heart-shaped button. The button's color should change accordingly.
- **Persistence:** Ensure that the user's actions (e.g., adding/removing advertisements from favorites) persist even after page refresh.
- **Modal Window:** Display a modal window with detailed information about a camper advertisement when the "Show more" button is clicked. The modal should close when the close button ("x"), backdrop, or the "Esc" key is pressed.
- **Form:** Include a form in the modal window for booking a camper. The form should have fields for name, email, booking date, and comment. Name, email, and booking date fields are mandatory and should be validated before submission.
- **Price Format:** Display the rental price as a single value (e.g., 8000) and format it with commas (e.g., 8,000) in the UI.
